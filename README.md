## Summary
#### 
Over a third of employees are at retirement age. can create massive gaps. will need to prepare for leadership and regular employee hiring. could potentially restructure or shrink some departments, but with current numbers, if want to keep same numbers, will need to hire 133,776 new people. if wanting to promote from within, not enough qualified mentors from current queries. may need to expand what counts as qualified. expanding by birthdate by two days increases the mentor pool by over 30,000. if wanting to tackle specifically the retirements in dev and sales, a query can be created to pull those individuals specifically. can then speak with managers to decide if these positions can be streamlined or poll these potential mentors.
